# 13F-investor-graphs
This is a public repository for my thesis "Examination of Institutional Investor Network Patterns in Context of Major Crashes in US Stock Markets. It contains raw, processed data, as well as code snippets as Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to explore and contribute, although, codes might gave errors due to packages or file paths.

Some of the files are not included due to their size. These files are edges.csv, interactions_final.csv, processed_interactions.csv and historical_stock_prices.csv

However, you can find the base data, which are extracted 13F filings, from the address below:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZRH3EU

Code consists of functions and snippets to process this 13F filings data, stock information and stock price information, by linking them using stock tickers and CUSIP keys. In addition, processed data such as extracted motif counts, graph metrics etc. are also provided as csv files.
